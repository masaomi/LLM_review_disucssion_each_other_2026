      "response": "# The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter\n\nEvery evening, Maria lit the lighthouse while watching the fishing boat return. She'd light a candle in her window—a habit her mother started decades ago.\n\nOn that boat, old Thomas always paused his work to admire the twin glows. They reminded him of his late wife's signals, back when they were young and secretly courting.\n\nHe never knew the woman in the window was his daughter, given up at birth. She never knew her father sailed past nightly, heart light with memories of a love she represented.\n\nThe adoption papers burned in the lighthouse fire of 1962.\n\n---\n\n**Narrative Technique (47 words):**\nI used dramatic irony—readers possess knowledge denied to both characters, creating poignant tension. The parallel structure (her watching/his watching) emphasizes their unknowing connection. The final sentence delivers a twist: the evidence of their relationship is destroyed, ensuring this tragic near-miss remains permanent, reframing their nightly ritual as irreversible loss.",

      "response": "# The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter\n\nEvery morning, she placed a candle in the window, its light guiding him home from the sea. He thought some kind stranger lived there. She thought the fisherman never noticed.\n\nHe began leaving wildflowers at the doorstep to thank whoever kept the flame burning. She assumed neighborhood children picked her garden light of its roses again.\n\nTheir gifts crossed like ships, each believing themselves invisible to the other.\n\nHe carried her eyes. She carried his stubbornness. Neither carried the truth.\n\nThe adoption records, sealed forty years ago, listed them under the same light-haired woman's name.\n\n---\n\n**Technique:** Dramatic irony drives the story—the reader assembles clues (shared traits, sealed records) that reveal a mother-child relationship neither character suspects, while their unconscious mutual caretaking becomes deeply poignant only after the final revelation reframes every exchange as inherited love.",
