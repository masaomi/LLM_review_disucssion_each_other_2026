      "reasoning": "This response demonstrates exceptional logical reasoning and completeness. The formalization of premises in predicate logic (Question 1 setup) shows sophisticated understanding. The chain reasoning for Question 1 is flawless, correctly applying hypothetical syllogism. For Question 2, the response excellently identifies that P3 is 'isolated' from the P1-P2 chain and correctly notes that no connection between sea creatures and mammals/warm-bloodedness is established in the premises. The table of invalid conclusions in Question 3 is particularly valuable, covering multiple fallacies with clear explanations. The response correctly avoids the trap of assuming whales are sea creatures (which is real-world knowledge not stated in premises). The only minor issue is that the response could have been slightly more explicit about why we can't conclude anything about sea creatures being warm-blooded (i.e., explicitly stating that 'whales are sea creatures' is not a premise). The clarity is outstanding with excellent organization, and the logical consistency is impeccable throughout.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "One could argue there's a subtle point worth discussing: while the response correctly notes we cannot conclude 'some sea creatures are whales,' in many real-world logic exercises the implicit assumption is that whales are sea creatures. The response does acknowledge this ('even though real-world whales are sea creatures, that fact is never stated in the premises') but could have briefly noted that if an additional premise 'all whales are sea creatures' were added, additional conclusions would follow — this would add pedagogical value.",
        "The claim that P3 supports 'almost no further inferences on its own' is slightly imprecise — P3 does entail that sea creatures exist and that at least one thing is not a whale, which are minor but valid inferences that could have been explicitly listed for completeness"
      ],
      "reasoning": "This is an exceptionally strong response. The accuracy is near-perfect: the main valid conclusion (all whales are warm-blooded) is correctly derived, and the response correctly avoids all common logical traps. The treatment of what cannot be concluded is particularly impressive — the table of invalid inferences with named fallacies goes well beyond what most responses would provide. The key insight that 'some S are not W' does not entail 'some S are W' is handled correctly, which is a frequent source of error. The only minor accuracy concern is that the response could have been slightly more explicit about the trivial inferences from P3 (existence of sea creatures, existence of non-whales). The logical consistency is excellent throughout, with no contradictions or errors in reasoning. The clarity is outstanding with formal notation, clear section headers, a summary table, and a concise conclusion. The originality score reflects the thorough treatment of invalid inferences and the identification of specific named fallacies, which goes beyond a standard answer.",
