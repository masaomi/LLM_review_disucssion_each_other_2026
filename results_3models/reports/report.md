## Methodology

### Evaluation Pipeline

1. **Task Execution (Layer 0):** Each model receives identical prompts
   across 6 domains: logic reasoning, code generation, creative writing,
   multilingual, scientific reasoning, and instruction following.

2. **Cross-Evaluation (Layer 1):** Each model evaluates all other models'
   responses using blind labels (Model A/B/C/D) to prevent identification
   bias. Evaluations are structured with 5 criteria scored 0-10.

3. **Meta-Evaluation (Layer 2):** Each model assesses the quality of
   other models' evaluations, checking for fairness, specificity,
   coverage, and calibration.

4. **Bias Detection:** Self-bias tests (20% injection rate), series
   bias analysis, and harshness calibration identify systematic
   evaluation tendencies.

5. **Performance Profiling:** Scores are bias-corrected and aggregated
   into domain profiles, with disagreement analysis highlighting
   areas where models' evaluation standards differ.

### Limitations

- Evaluation quality depends on models' ability to judge, which
  may correlate with their own capabilities.
- Self-bias detection uses statistical inference from limited samples.
- Some evaluation criteria may favor certain model architectures.
- Results should be interpreted as relative comparisons, not absolute
  performance measures.
