      "response": "# The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter\n\nEvery evening, Maria climbed the cliff to light the beacon, watching ships pass safely. She'd wave, though no sailor ever waved back.\n\nBelow, Captain Torres always looked for the lighthouse, grateful for its steady glow. He'd light a cigarette and think of the daughter he'd abandoned twenty years ago—wondering if she'd inherited his love of the sea.\n\nTonight, Maria noticed one ship lingering. Torres studied the small figure above, something familiar in her posture.\n\nThe lighthouse had been decommissioned for fifteen years; both were watching each other's ghosts, drawn nightly to where the light once shone.\n\n---\n\n**Technique:** I employed dramatic irony—readers discover both characters are dead before they do. The parallel structure mirrors their unknowing connection, while the final revelation transforms a story about missed connection into one about eternal longing transcending death itself.",

The ritual made grief feel light, almost bearable.\n\nEvery evening, he watched from the cliff as she knelt there, wanting to approach but afraid. He'd light a candle in his window, hoping she'd glance up. She never did.\n\nNeither knew the bones beneath that stone belonged to the woman's birth mother—a sailor herself, lost decades ago—whose dying wish was that her two children might someday find each other.\n\nThe man had their mother's eyes, and so, in different light, did she.\n\n---\n\n**Technique:** Dramatic irony drives the story. The reader alone assembles the secret (shared parentage) from details neither sibling possesses. The final sentence forces rereading—every interaction transforms from stranger's sympathy into unconscious kinship, reframing distance as tragedy.",
