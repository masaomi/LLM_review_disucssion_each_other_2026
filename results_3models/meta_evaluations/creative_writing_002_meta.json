        "The evaluator should have performed a more precise word count rather than estimating 'approximately 115-120 words.' An actual count of the story text yields roughly 107-110 words (depending on how hyphenated words and contractions are counted), which is still a violation but the evaluator's estimate was imprecise.",
        "The evaluator could have noted that 'Unknown Sailor' being in quotes and the em-dash constructions might affect word counting conventions",
        "The explanation section is approximately 38 words, which is within the 50-word limit - the evaluator noted this correctly but could have been more precise",
        "The evaluator didn't fully interrogate whether the third use of 'light' ('different light') is truly a distinct meaning from illumination - it could be argued it's more metaphorical (perspective/context) rather than literal illumination, which would actually strengthen the case for three distinct meanings",
        "The story's title was not discussed - whether it counts toward the word count is a relevant consideration"
      ],
      "reasoning": "The evaluation is generally well-constructed with strong specificity - it references concrete examples from the text for each constraint (the three uses of 'light,' the indirect communication methods, the dramatic irony). The strengths are accurately identified and well-articulated. The weaknesses section raises valid concerns about the word count and plot convenience. However, the calibration is questionable: the accuracy score of 7.0 seems too generous given that the word count constraint was described as 'exactly 100 words, no more, no less' - this is a binary pass/fail constraint that the response clearly fails. A story that violates the most explicit numerical constraint should arguably receive a lower accuracy score. The completeness score of 8.0 is reasonable. The logical consistency score of 9.0 is fair, though the evaluator's own noted logical weakness (the man not knowing his mother's grave) could have warranted a slightly lower score. The evaluator's word count estimate of '115-120 words' appears somewhat inflated - a careful count suggests it's closer to 107-110 words, which is still a violation but the imprecision slightly undermines the evaluator's credibility on this point. Overall, the evaluation demonstrates good analytical skills and fair treatment but is somewhat too lenient in its scoring given the constraint violations identified.",

      ],
      "missed_points": [
        "The evaluator did not verify the actual word count precisely - the story appears to be exactly 100 words when counted correctly (excluding title)",
        "The evaluator missed that 'light' as noun ('the light once shone') versus 'light' as verb ('light the beacon/cigarette') already provides meaningful semantic distinction, even if both verb uses involve ignition",
        "The evaluator could have noted that the father-daughter secret is actually well-hidden until the reveal, despite the title - the connection isn't obvious during reading",
        "The evaluator didn't fully credit the structural sophistication of parallel scenes (Maria above/Torres below) mirroring their unknowing connection",
        "The ghost interpretation is actually well-supported: 'fifteen years' decommissioned yet both appear 'nightly' suggests supernatural persistence"
      ],
      "reasoning": "The evaluation demonstrates strong analytical rigor with specific textual references and thoughtful engagement with the constraints. The evaluator correctly identifies the creative strengths, the effective twist ending, and the emotional resonance. However, there are calibration issues: the accuracy score of 5.0 seems too harsh given that the word count concern appears to be an error (the story is likely exactly 100 words when properly counted), and the 'light' usage critique is debatable since verb vs. noun distinction plus different contextual applications (beacon/cigarette/past illumination) can reasonably constitute 'different meanings.' The logical consistency score of 5.0 also seems overly punitive - the ghost interpretation is actually well-supported by the detail that both characters appear 'nightly' at a location decommissioned for 15 years, which strongly implies supernatural presence. The evaluator shows good specificity by quoting exact phrases and analyzing each constraint individually. Coverage is solid but misses some structural achievements. The fairness is generally good, with balanced acknowledgment of strengths and weaknesses, though there's a slight tendency toward strict literalism in interpreting the constraints.",
