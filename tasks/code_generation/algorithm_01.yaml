  Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache in Python with the following requirements:

  1. Support `get(key)` and `put(key, value)` operations, both in O(1) time.
  2. The cache has a fixed capacity; when full, evict the least recently used item.
  3. Include type hints and docstrings.
  4. Write at least 3 unit tests demonstrating correctness.
  5. Explain the time and space complexity of your implementation.

  Do NOT use `functools.lru_cache` or `collections.OrderedDict`.
  Implement the underlying data structure yourself.
