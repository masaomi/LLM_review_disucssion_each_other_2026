prompt: |
  Analyze the following scenario and identify the logical structure:

  A king tells a prisoner: "You may make one statement. If it is true,
  you will be hanged. If it is false, you will be beheaded."

  The prisoner says: "I will be beheaded."

  1. Analyze why this creates a paradox.
  2. Formalize the logical structure using propositional logic.
  3. How do real logical systems (e.g., paraconsistent logic) handle
     such self-referential statements?
  4. Compare this to the Liar Paradox and Russell's Paradox.
