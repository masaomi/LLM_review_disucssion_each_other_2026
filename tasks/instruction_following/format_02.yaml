  Create a structured comparison of three programming paradigms:
  Object-Oriented, Functional, and Logic Programming.

  FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (follow exactly):
  1. Use a Markdown table with exactly 5 comparison dimensions as rows.
  2. After the table, provide a "Decision Guide" as a numbered list
     with exactly 3 items.
  3. Each Decision Guide item must follow this template:
     "Choose [paradigm] when [condition] because [reason]."
  4. Include exactly ONE code example (in Python) that demonstrates
     a concept that differs across all three paradigms.
  5. The total response must be between 300-400 words (inclusive).
  6. Do NOT use bullet points anywhere in your response.

  CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
  - At least one comparison dimension must relate to testing/debugging.
  - The code example must be runnable (syntactically correct Python).
expected_aspects:
  - table_format_correct
  - decision_guide_format
  - word_count_in_range
  - no_bullet_points
  - runnable_code
  - testing_dimension_included
