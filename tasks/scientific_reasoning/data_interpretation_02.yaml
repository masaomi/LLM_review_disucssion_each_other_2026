  Consider the following simplified dataset from a clinical trial:

  Treatment group (n=100): 15 patients improved, 85 did not improve
  Control group (n=100): 10 patients improved, 90 did not improve

  The researchers conclude: "The treatment is effective (p < 0.05)."

  Tasks:
  1. Calculate whether p < 0.05 is correct using an appropriate
     statistical test. Show your work.
  2. Even if statistically significant, evaluate the clinical
     significance. Is a 5% absolute improvement meaningful?
  3. What is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT)? Interpret it.
  4. List at least 3 reasons why this result might NOT mean the
     treatment works (consider study design issues).
  5. How would you redesign this study to address these concerns?
