  A researcher observes that plants grown under blue LED lights
  produce 30% more biomass than plants grown under red LED lights,
  despite both groups receiving the same total photon flux.

  Tasks:
  1. Generate at least 3 plausible hypotheses to explain this observation.
  2. For each hypothesis, design a specific experiment to test it.
     Include controls, variables, and expected outcomes.
  3. Identify potential confounding variables in the original observation.
  4. What additional data would you need before drawing conclusions?
